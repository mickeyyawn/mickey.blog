- Pick a cloud.  Concentrate on it.  Get good at it before trying to use other clouds.
  If you try and make every cloud available to your developers, you will dilute your teams knowledge, increase operational complexity, and slow down the process of 
  moving to the cloud.  
- Require certifications for ANYONE that wants to use the cloud.
- Make sure one or more security engineers are part of the team. ISO can be separate, but make sure security is discussed in pretty much every meeting.  The best way to assure that is have a security engineer embedded in the team.
- Cloud native vs. hybrid vs. "lift and shift".
- Understand billing FIRST.

Vendor lock-in.  We saw it primarily in 2 areas.  Data.  Once they have their
hands on your data, is hellaciously expensive to get it out.  API topoology. As soon as you
start using layers that are hard to migrate out (for instance AWS API gateway on top of lambda vs. 
running docker containers that have all your api logic baked in)

Security and costs seem to come after the fact.  

TAGS - understand tags, what they are capable of, how to standardize, etc...

Costs - Your finance geeks may be surprised with how much running in the cloud costs. In
other words you may not save money, it may actually cost you more.  Understand the bigger
reasons for moving to the cloud.  Reinforce that every chance you get.


Culture - Change is HARD for a lot of teams.  A large swath of your IT department will resist moving 
to the cloud.  Know that upfront.

Incentivized devs with give aways.  Talk about Don here.  e.g. my previous boss nailed this.
As soon as you put programs in place that entice devs, then migration velocities increase
and learning curves behind to flatten out.   Trip to re:invent might have been better than
cold hard cash.
