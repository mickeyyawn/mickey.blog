Recently I lost my job. Luckily I was given a pretty generous severance. Even with that I struggled to
find a job. So I learned a few lessons that will hopefully help me next time.

1. Make sure you stay current on technologies, certifications and advanced degrees. It was crazy
   how many jobs actually list specific certifications and/or advanced degrees before they will
   even entertain a phone screen with you, no matter how many years of experience you have or what
   you have accomplished.

2. An oldie but a goodie is have 6 months salary set aside. This is CRUCIAL. NEVER be without at least
   that much in the bank as a cushion.

3. Maintain a current project portfolio site.

4. Maintain a blog/personal site. More and more companies are listing that as a field when you apply
   (Personal website)

5. Have a side hustle. Alternate income to tide you over between jobs is important.

6. Make sure you are incorporated. This looks great on Linkedin and allows you to take contract
   work and have a liability blanket along with a tax shelter.

7. Evaluate your appearance every few months. Ask yourself, "If I were to lose my job tomorrow, can
   I fit into my interview suit? Is my interview suit modern or is straight out of the 80's? Would I
   be confident in my appearance going to an interview? Should I get Lasik or teeth whitening? Would
   that make me more confident?

8. Revisit your resume every 3 or 4 months. Make sure it is current and up to date with
   accomplishments, training, technologies, certifications, etc.

9. Live frugally. Don't have a massive car payment or extravagant lifestyle that will eat into
   your cushion quickly.

10. Live lightly/minimalistally. This makes you mobile. I wish we would have been in a position,
    both from a possessions standpoint, and house standpoint to be able to sell everything and move
    west. It was the perfect opportunity.

11. NEVER stay at a company more than 3 or 4 years. Longer than that a) makes you a layoff
    target b) your skills might atrophy, you may be more known for "you" than for your skillset
    or accomplishments. c) you may grow complacent and stop challenging yourself d) after a few years you
    are probably burned out on that company and not even realize it until you leave.

12. ALWAYS reply to recruiters and connect to them even when you already have a job. They may annoy you at the time or the job they are pushing is shit but you never know when you might need their help.

13. Another oldie but a goodie is that it's not WHAT you know but WHO you know. Maintain the biggest
    professional network you can. Once again you never know when you will need to ask someone for help.
