Inspired by Bill Gates.

Losing your job through a layoff SUCKS.  Yes, I got a great severance based on my years of service (and Turnerâ€™s generosity), but NO ONE prepares you for the mind fuck that occurs to you in the aftermath.  Going through the 7 stages of guilt over and over.  Sleeping till 11am everyday because you are too tired to deal with life.  Waking up every night for months dealing with anxiety, self-doubt and panic.  Realizing you were dealing with technology burnout when you were 

One thing that took me several months to recognize is that I was 100% burned out even before I lost my job.  Technology and coding were no longer passions they once were.  Dealing with problem employees, horrible customers, a long commute, and meeting after meeting had worn me down.  If I could have realized that early in the severance time line, I could have addressed it.  

Having a sick pet is an emotional roller coaster.

Commuting 3 hours per day to a job that you are burned out on is NO WAY to live.

Alcohol dependence is a difficult thing to deal with. I spent too many days in 2018 day drinking, having more than 2 or 3 drinks, and drinking day after day without taking a break.  Never again.

House renovations that go on for multiple years will STRESS YOU OUT.  

Having a variety of interests and hobbies (not just golf!) is CRUCIAL to having a happy life.  

I love to travel more than I ever have in the past.  I appreciate and embrace what going to a new place in the world does for your attitude.
